# Leet Dart

Just for fun!

## What is it?

A collection of solutions to leetcode problems, but in Dart.

Also, the "unleet" section: for each problem, a `beginner/` dir that holds
simpler challenges.

## Why?

This is a personal project. I'm learning Dart. I think leetcode problems are a
fun mental challenge. This project melds both worlds.

## What can I do with it?

Here are the basic ideas:
*   Pick a problem. Copy the "problem_name.dart" file into dartpad. Write some
    Dart and try to get the tests to pass. Check your solution agains the
    soluton folder.
*   Add a new problem.
*   Improve an existing problem.
*   Add more tests to existing problems
*   Beginner? Learn some Dart by using the /beginner drives.

Have fun!
